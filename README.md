# PointPlotter
Graphical version of a school project for plotting points

Basically this project plots points onto a graph based on what the user enters into the text fields labeled x and y.
In order for the points to be added both to a linked list which stores them, and to be plotted on the graph, the submit button
must be pressed. Then if the user presses the calculate perimeter button, it will draw the lines connecting each of the points
and then fill in the area bounded by them. Technically, the lines are drawn after the area is filled in, but they occur at
nearly the same time. The clear button clears the canvas and redraws the grid and clears all the data which had been stored
so far.
